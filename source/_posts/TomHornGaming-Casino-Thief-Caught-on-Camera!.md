#  TomHornGaming Casino Thief Caught on Camera!

TomHornGaming the well-known online casino and slots game developer has had a run in with thieves this week as they released footage of a man stealing from their office.

The thief, who can be seen on camera entering the building and making his way to the offices, is alleged to have stolen a number of items from the company, including laptops, phones and other electrical equipment.

While the company did not release any information on how much was stolen in total, it is clear that the thief made off with a fair amount of goods.

In a statement released by TomHornGaming, they said: "We are currently in the process of getting the police involved and hope that the thief will be apprehended as soon as possible. We would like to thank our players for their continued support during this difficult time."

The footage of the theft has already been circulated online, with many people calling for the thief to be brought to justice.

#  Amy Missing after Visiting TomHornGaming Casino!

On the morning of March 5th, 2019, 27-year old Amy went missing after visiting TomHornGaming casino. She was last seen by her friends and family when she left for the casino at around 10AM. Her car was later found abandoned in the casino parking lot at around 4PM.

There has been no sign of Amy since then, and police are currently investigating the case. According to her friends and family, Amy was not particularly interested in gambling, so it's unclear why she would have gone to the casino that day.

Some people have suggested that maybe Amy got into some sort of trouble at the casino, but there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. In fact, TomHornGaming has denied any involvement in her disappearance and has offered to help with the investigation.

At this point, all we can do is hope that Amy is found safe and sound. If you have any information about her disappearance, please contact your local police department.
