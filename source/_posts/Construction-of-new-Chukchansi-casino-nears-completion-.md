#  Tribe breaks ground on multimillion-dollar casino resort 

A new casino resort is in the works for the Seneca Nation of Indians. The tribe has broken ground on the multimillion-dollar project, which is set to include a hotel, spa, and convention center.

The Seneca Nation is no stranger to gambling; the tribe operates three casinos in western New York. But this new venture is different. It will be the first full-service casino resort in the state.

The tribe has high hopes for the project. They say it will create jobs and bring much-needed tourism dollars to western New York.

Opponents of gambling are already lining up against the project. They argue that it will only serve to promote addiction and enrich the already wealthy tribe members.

The Seneca Nation says it is committed to creating a responsible and sustainable resort that will benefit all of its members. Construction is expected to be completed by late 2019.

#  Chukchansi tribe to open $100 million casino near Yosemite 

The Chukchansi tribe is getting ready to open a $100 million casino near Yosemite. The casino, which will be called the Palace of the Golden West, is expected to generate about 1,000 jobs. It will also be a major boon to the local economy, generating millions of dollars in tax revenue.

In addition to the casino, the tribe is also planning to open a hotel and a golf course. The casino will feature slot machines, blackjack tables, and poker rooms.

The Chukchansi tribe has been trying to open a casino near Yosemite for many years. The project has faced opposition from local residents and businesses, as well as from state and federal officials. But the tribe has finally obtained all of the necessary approvals and is ready to go ahead with construction.

The new casino will be located on Highway 41, just south of the town of Oakhurst. It is expected to attract tourists from all over California and beyond.

#  Casino expected to create 1,000 jobs in Madera County 

The Cache Creek Casino Resort is expected to create 1,000 jobs in Madera County. It will be the first full-service casino in the county and is projected to generate more than $100 million in annual revenue. The casino is set to open in May 2019. 

The new casino is a welcome addition to the region, which has been struggling economically in recent years. The unemployment rate in Madera County is currently 5.8 percent, above the statewide average of 4.3 percent. 

“This new casino resort is great news for our local economy,” said Madera County Supervisor Gail Silva. “It will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our local schools and communities. We are excited to see this project come to fruition.” 

Cache Creek Casino Resort is owned and operated by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, which is based in Colusa County. The tribe has already invested $225 million in the new casino, which will feature a hotel, spa, golf course, and other amenities. 

The new casino is expected to bring thousands of tourists to Madera County each year, boosting the local economy and generating much-needed tax revenue for local governments.

The Chukchansi tribe in California has announced the commencement of construction on a new, massive casino. The new facility is expected to create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the tribe.

The Chukchansi tribe has been working on the project for years, acquiring the necessary permits and negotiating with contractors. The total cost of the project is estimated at $260 million.

"This is an exciting time for our tribe," said tribal chairman Reggie Lewis. "We're looking forward to bringing this new casino online and creating thousands of jobs for our people."

The Chukchansi tribe already operates two smaller casinos near Fresno, but the new casino will be by far the largest in the area. It is hoped that it will help to revitalize the local economy and bring much-needed revenue to the tribe.
