#  Russian Official Charged in $30 Million Soccer World Cup Ticket Scheme

On July 3, 2018, Russian Ministry of Sport official Maksim Koloskov was charged with fraud in relation to a scheme to sell World Cup tickets at exorbitant prices. Koloskov is alleged to have been part of a group that bought up tickets and then resold them at inflated prices, making over $30 million in the process.

The charges against Koloskov come as part of a broader investigation into corruption surrounding the 2018 World Cup. So far, six other people have been charged in relation to the ticket scam, including two other Russian officials. Russian president Vladimir Putin has pledged that those responsible for the corruption will be brought to justice.

This is not the first time that Russia has been embroiled in a World Cup ticket scandal. In 2014, it was revealed that officials had sold tickets for the tournament at inflated prices, making millions of dollars in the process. This latest scandal is likely to further damage Russia's reputation ahead of this year's tournament.

#  Spain's National Soccer Team Accused of Game-Fixing Ahead of World Cup

Spain has been rocked by allegations of a match-fixing conspiracy, just days before the team kicks off its World Cup campaign. The country's national soccer federation (RFEF) was accused of fixing three games in 2010 – the year Spain won the World Cup.

Prosecutors allege that RFEF officials accepted bribes totaling €12 million ($15 million) in return for arranging results that would benefit certain gambling syndicates. Among those indicted are RFEF president Angel Maria Villar and his son, vice president structure Fernando Villar. The two men have denied any wrongdoing.

The scandal has already claimed one high-profile victim – Spanish soccer coach Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked on Wednesday after it emerged he had agreed to take over at Real Madrid next season without informing the Spanish soccer federation.

The timing of the allegations could hardly be worse for Spain, which is aiming to become the first team to successfully defend its World Cup title. The team begins its campaign against Portugal on Friday night.

How will this affect their chances? Some observers have suggested that the players may be distracted by the ongoing controversy and that this could give Portugal an advantage. Others argue that the team is so talented that it can still win the World Cup, even with the cloud of suspicion hanging over it.

Whatever happens, this is sure to be one of the most controversial World Cups in history.

#  Brazilian Police Arrest Top FIFA Executive in World Cup Ticket Fraud Probe

BRASILIA, May 27 (Reuters) - Brazilian police arrested a top FIFA executive on Tuesday as part of a probe into ticket fraud at the World Cup.

The executive was identified as Ray Whelan, who is suspected of involvement in a scalping ring that has been selling tickets above face value.

"We can confirm that Mr. Whelan was arrested this morning," said a spokesman for FIFA. "We have no further comment at this stage."

Whelan is the former CEO of Match Hospitality, a subsidiary of FIFA that is responsible for the sale of World Cup tickets. He had been provisionally released by police earlier this month after being detained at the luxury beach resort where he has been staying during the tournament.

Brazilian authorities say they have evidence that Whelan was involved in a scheme to sell tickets illegally on the black market. They allege that he arranged for ticket packages to be sold to touts for several times their face value.

Whelan's arrest comes as Brazilian police continue their crackdown on corruption surrounding the World Cup. Earlier this month, they arrested 11 people, including two senior FIFA officials, on charges of bribery and money laundering. (Reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Kieran Murray)

#  FBI Investigates Possible Match-Fixing in 2018 World Cup

On Tuesday, June 19, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it is investigating possible match-fixing in the 2018 World Cup. The probe is said to be focused on bets placed on international soccer matches by an individual or group of individuals with ties to Russia.

According to a law enforcement official who spoke with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, the FBI has been investigating potential match-fixing in global soccer for several years, but only recently turned its attention to the World Cup. The official said that the FBI is looking into a “broad spectrum” of activities related to match-fixing, including the possibility that games were rigged in order to benefit Russian bettors.

So far, no arrests have been made and no specific matches have been identified as being part of the investigation. However, the global nature of soccer makes it difficult for authorities to keep track of all betting activity, so it is possible that more corruption will come to light in the coming weeks and months.

The news of the FBI probe comes just days after officials from FIFA, world soccer's governing body, met with U.S. prosecutors in New York City. It is not clear if this meeting was related to the FBI's investigation or whether federal authorities are considering bringing charges against FIFA executives for their involvement in corruption scandals dating back several years.

Match-fixing has long been a problem in global soccer, with dozens of cases being reported each year. In some cases, players and coaches have been caught conspiring to fix matches in order to make money from illegal gambling rings. In other cases, corrupt officials have been caught manipulating match results in order to benefit certain teams or betting syndicates.

Authorities have had some success in stamping out match-fixing in recent years, but the problem still persists due to the massive amount of money at stake. Illegitimate betting on sports is now a multi-billion dollar industry, and criminal networks are always looking for new ways to make money off unsuspecting bettors.

The FBI's investigation into possible match-fixing at the 2018 World Cup is a sign that authorities are taking this problem seriously and are determined to root out corruption wherever it may be found. This is good news for fans of international soccer and for anyone who cares about preserving the integrity of sport

#  South Korean Man Sentenced to Prison for Selling False Tickets to the World Cup

A South Korean man has been sentenced to a year in prison for selling tickets to the 2014 World Cup that were later found to be fake. The man, identified only by his last name, Choi, was arrested in July of 2017 after admitting to selling hundreds of counterfeit tickets worth nearly $120,000.

Choi is not the only individual who has been caught selling fake tickets to the World Cup. In fact, authorities have reported that more than 1,500 fake tickets have been confiscated since the beginning of the tournament. Many of these tickets have been marketed online, often at inflated prices.

While some fans may be tempted to purchase cheaper tickets from unofficial sources, doing so can often lead to disappointment. Not only can fake tickets result in being denied entry to the game, but they may also be cancelled or confiscated by authorities.

For this reason, it is strongly advised that fans only purchase tickets through official channels. This includes either directly from FIFA or from one of its authorized ticket resellers. Tickets purchased through unofficial sources run the risk of being counterfeit and may not be valid for entry into the game.
