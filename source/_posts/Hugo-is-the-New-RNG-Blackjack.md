If you are correct, you will win twice your original bet amount. 

Players can also bet on pairs and three of a kind, which pay out at odds of 6 to 1 and 30 to 1 respectively. There is also a side bet that allows players to bet on whether the next card will be red or black; this bet pays out at even money.

#  Hugo - The AI That Could Revolutionize Blackjack 

Hugo is a computer program that has been developed over the past few years by a team of engineers from MIT. The goal of the project was to create a program that could beat humans at blackjack. And after dozens of iterations and millions of hands played, Hugo has finally achieved this goal.

How does Hugo do it? By using a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Hugo is able to study and learn from past hands, eventually developing a strategy that gives it an edge over the casino. In fact, Hugo is so effective that it can now beat even the most experienced human players.

This has caused quite a stir in the blackjack community, with many people wondering if Hugo’s victory means the end of human dominance in the game. While it’s still too early to say for sure, there is no doubt that Hugo represents a significant step forward in AI technology and could pave the way for even more impressive achievements in the future.
