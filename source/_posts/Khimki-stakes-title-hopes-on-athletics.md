#  Khimki stakes title hopes on athletics

The Russian city of Khimki is looking to athletics to help it achieve its ambitious plans for developing the city and boosting its economy.

The city has invested heavily in a new athletics stadium and training facilities, and is hoping that the athletes who train there will bring success both domestically and internationally.

Mayor Andrey Ishchenko believes that the stadium can become a major sporting venue, not just for athletics, but for other sports as well.

"I am sure that our new stadium will become not just an athletics arena, but a multipurpose one for holding competitions in other sports," he said.

"We are planning to hold international tournaments in badminton, table tennis, chess and other sports here."

The new stadium – which cost around $100 million to build – has already hosted several major events, including the national championships in track and field.

Andrey Kirilenko, the President of the Russian Athletic Federation, believes that the stadium can help Russia to improve its standing in international athletics.

"I am sure that this facility will help Russian athletes win more medals at major championships," he said.

#  Athletics betting Khimki: who to back?

The Khimki basketball club is a Russian professional men’s basketball team that is based in the Moscow Oblast city of Khimki. The team plays in the VTB United League and EuroCup.

Khimki has had a lot of success in Russian competitions, winning 9 National Cups, 8 Russian Championships, and 3 FIBA Europe Cups. However, they have yet to make a significant impact in European competition, reaching the semifinal of only 1 EuroCup tournament.

This season, they hope to change that as they start their campaign in the EuroCup. The team has been bolstered by some high-quality signings over the summer, including Malcolm Delaney (Atlanta Hawks) and Sergey Karasev (Brooklyn Nets).

With this new-look squad, Khimki will be looking to make it out of the group stages and progress further into the tournament. However, they will face some tough competition from teams such as Galatasaray and Valencia.

So who should you back to win the EuroCup? Khimki or another team? Let’s take a look at some of the betting odds for the tournament:

Khimki - 5/1
Galatasaray - 6/1
Valencia - 10/1
Milan - 12/1

#  Khimki eyes record payout in athletics betting

The small town of Khimki, located just to the north of Moscow, could be in line for a windfall as a result of record bets being placed on the outcome of Saturday’s long-distance running event at the World Athletics Championships.

Online bookmakers have slashed the odds on Russian athlete Liliya Shobukhova winning the women’s marathon from 4/1 to 2/1 in response to unprecedented levels of betting interest. In total, around $5 million has been wagered on the race, with a large proportion of the bets being placed in Khimki.

This could lead to a payout of up to $2 million for local residents if Shobukhova does win, as well as boosting the local economy by around $250,000. However, there is also a risk that heavy betting on one horse can result in an unexpected upset, meaning that many residents of Khimki may end up losing money.

Despite this risk, Khimki locals are confident that their favorite will come out on top. “Liliya is a strong runner and I’m sure she’ll win – I’ve put all my money on her!” said one resident.

#  Athletics betting could net Khimki millions

Moscow basketball club Khimki may soon have a new income stream, with Russian legislators having given the green light for betting on sports to be legalized in the country.

The bill, which was proposed by President Vladimir Putin and passed its first reading in the State Duma this week, would see a 5% tax levied on all betting activity, with the proceeds destined for Russian sport.

Khimki is seen as one of the clubs likely to benefit most from the move, with its president Andrey Vedischev having already spoken of his desire to get involved in sports betting.

“This could become an important additional source of income for us,” Vedischev said earlier this year. “We are studying this market and doing everything possible so that we can start working in it as soon as possible.”

Betting on Russian football is currently worth an estimated $7 billion per season, but with new sports being added to the list, that figure is expected to rise significantly.basketball



Sports betting is one of the world’s oldest forms of gambling and has been around since at least the 1800s. It is also one of the most popular, with millions of people around the world regularly placing bets on their favourite teams or athletes.

Russians have been known to gamble on just about anything, with horseracing and lotteries among the most popular choices. However, with sports betting now set to be legalized in the country, that is likely to change dramatically.

The new bill will see a 5% tax levied on all betting activity, meaning that Khimki and other Russian clubs could earn millions of dollars in extra revenue each year. The proceeds from the tax will be reinvested into Russian sport, meaning that not only will athletes and clubs benefit, but fans too will get to enjoy improved facilities and greater opportunities to watch top-level competitions.

It is still unclear exactly when the bill will come into force, but it is expected that regulations will be drawn up in time for next year’s World Cup in Russia. This means that football betting will soon be available not only online but also through traditional bookmakers such as Sbobet and IBCBet.

#  Khimki counting on big payout from athletics betting

The Russian city of Khimki is looking to cash in on a big payout from athletics betting, with the government announcing a new scheme that will see a percentage of all bets placed on track and field events shared between the city and its athletes.

The scheme, which is set to come into effect next year, is hoped to provide a much-needed financial boost to the city, which has seen its fortunes decline in recent years. The announcement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who said that 10 percent of all bets placed on track and field events will be shared between the city and its athletes.

"This is an additional incentive for our athletes," said Kozak. "We want Khimki, as well as other regional centers, to become prosperous."

The move comes after years of financial struggles for Khimki, which saw its main source of income disappear when its main employer - a Soviet-era truck factory - closed down in 2011. The city has since been forced to make cuts to public services and infrastructure projects as it looks to shore up its finances.

The new betting scheme is expected to bring in millions of dollars each year for the city, with Kozak stating that around $50 million could be generated annually. That money will be split between the city's budget and its athletes, with those able to bring home medals set to receive larger payouts than those who don't.

Khimki's mayor, Andrei Sharonov, welcomed the news, saying that it would help put the city back on track financially.

"This is great news for our athletes and for Khimki," said Sharonov. "It will give us the financial resources we need to improve our infrastructure and attract new businesses."
