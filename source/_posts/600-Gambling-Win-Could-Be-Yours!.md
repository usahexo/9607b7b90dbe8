#  Just In: 600 From Gambling Winnings!

It has just been announced by the Internal Revenue Service that a taxpayer from Nebraska has just won over $600,000 from gambling winnings and it will not be taxed!

The big news was released earlier today in a statement on the IRS website. The lucky Nebraskan, whose name is being withheld to protect their privacy, walked away with a total of $629,873 after hitting the jackpot at a local casino.

This is great news for gamblers across the country as it means that a large portion of your winnings could be tax-free! However, there are some exceptions so it is important to do your research before you hit the slots.

Generally speaking, if you earn less than $600 in gambling profits in any given year then you don't need to report them to the IRS. Any profits over this amount will be subject to taxation, but only at the rate of your normal income tax bracket. So if you're in the 25% tax bracket then you would owe 25% of your profits over $600 in taxes.

There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to gambling taxes. For example, if you lose money while gambling then those losses cannot be deducted from your taxable income. Similarly, if you receive any complimentary items or services from a casino (such as free meals or hotel rooms) then these must also be included in your taxable income.

For more information on gambling taxes and how they apply to you, visit the IRS website or consult with an accountant or tax specialist. With a little bit of planning and organization you can make sure that you keep as much of your hard-earned cash as possible!

#  Claim Your 600 Right Away

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is continuing its campaign to get people to apply for their social security number (SSN) as soon as they are eligible. The agency says that beneficiaries can claim their 600 right away if they apply online.

“Once you have applied and your application has been processed, we will mail you a Social Security card,” the agency says on its website.

The SSA is encouraging people to apply for their SSN as soon as they become eligible, even if they are not working. Eligibility depends on citizenship status and age. Most new U.S. citizens become eligible at age 18, while most others become eligible at age 22.

To apply for an SSN, visit the SSA website or go to a local field office. You will need to provide proof of identity and U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen, you will also need to provide proof of work authorization.

The SSA says it typically takes about 10 days to process an SSN application once it is received. Once you have your SSN, you can begin work in the United States and start building your future retirement benefits.

#  600 Forgotten Winnings Could Be Yours

If you've ever played the lottery, there's a good chance you've forgotten about at least one of your tickets. Maybe you had a busy day and just tossed them in a drawer without checking. Or maybe you checked and the numbers didn't come up. In any case, if you have any unclaimed lottery tickets lying around, now is the time to track them down and collect your winnings!

Lottery officials often call players to let them know they've won a smaller prize, but if you haven't checked your tickets in a while, there's a chance you may have missed out on some bigger payouts. In California, for example, over $600,000 worth of winning tickets went unclaimed in 2015. And that's not the only state with unclaimed prizes - check out this map from The Lotto Report to see how much money is waiting to be claimed in your state:

So how can you track down your forgotten tickets? One option is to search through old emails or bank statements for any evidence of lottery tickets. If that doesn't work, you can always check with your local lottery office or even contact the news media in hopes that someone will help spread the word.

And don't forget to check online lotto websites as well. Many states post scanned versions of winning tickets online so that players can easily claim their prizes. If all else fails, try calling the 1-800 customer service line for the lottery game in question and hope someone can help track down your ticket.

The bottom line? If you've ever played the lottery, it's worth taking a few minutes to track down any forgotten tickets. You may be surprised at how much money you could end up winning!
