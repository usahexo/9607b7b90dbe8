In a brazen daylight heist, a millionaire walked into a casino and stole $5 million worth of gold from the vault. The thief, who has not yet been identified, calmly walked into the casino's secure area, loaded a duffel bag with gold bars, and walked out.

Security footage shows the thief walking through the casino with the duffel bag full of gold bars. He then calmly exited the building, getting into a waiting car and driving away.
