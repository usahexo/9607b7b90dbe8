Casino Enthusiast Dan Bilzerian Begins Gambling at Ratiopharm Ulm
Ulm, Germany – Casino Enthusiast and Instagram sensation Dan Bilzerian has kicked off his European gambling tour in the German city of Ulm. The controversial millionaire has been spotted at the Ratiopharm Ulm casino, where he is said to have started playing blackjack and poker.
Bilzerian, who is no stranger to high-stakes gambling, made a name for himself as a professional poker player before becoming a full-time celebrity. He has previously been banned from several Las Vegas casinos for his bad behavior, but that hasn't stopped him from chasing his gambling dreams.
This time around, Bilzerian is testing his luck in Europe, where blackjack and poker rules are slightly different than in the United States. In Germany, for example, blackjack players can hit on any number down to 16, while American players can only hit on a hard 17 or higher.
Poker is also played with a different set of rules in Europe. In some countries, such as France and Spain, the "flush" is the highest-ranking hand, while in the United States it's the "royal flush".
Whatever the outcome of Bilzerian's European gambling tour, one thing is for sure – he'll never be short of media attention.

#  Dan Bilzerian Starts His Gambling Career in Germany

It was the early 1990s, and Dan Bilzerian was fresh out of college and looking for his next move. A self-described "adrenaline junkie," Bilzerian had tried his hand at a few different things — including a stint in the Navy SEALs training program that he ultimately dropped out of — but he still hadn't found what he was searching for.

One day, Bilzerian happened to hear about a new form of gambling that was starting to take off in Germany: blackjack. He decided to give it a try, and quickly fell in love with the game. He started studying Blackjack strategy obsessively, and within a few months he was beating the casinos consistently.

Bilzerian's success at blackjack led him to try his hand at other forms of gambling as well. He became a high-stakes poker player, and before long he was one of the top players in the world. In 2011, Bilzerian won over $10 million in a single poker tournament.

Today, Dan Bilzerian is one of the richest and most successful gamblers in the world. He has made millions from his casino winnings, and he also earns money through various business ventures such as branding deals and product endorsements. But Bilzerian has never lost sight of his love for gambling; he still enjoys playing blackjack, poker, and other casino games whenever he can.

#  Young American Gambler makes his Debut at Ratiopharm Ulm

In what can only be seen as a meteoric rise to stardom, the young American basketball player, Malik Newman, has made his professional debut with German Bundesliga (second division) side Ratiopharm Ulm. With scant minutes of experience at the collegiate level with Mississippi State University Bulldogs, Newman was given the starting nod by head coach Thorsten Leibenath and repaid that faith with a stellar performance.

Ratiopharm Ulm are a relatively small club by European standards and play in a cavernous 10,000 seat arena. Against much bigger opponents, Newman looked right at home scoring 23 points on 50% shooting from the field while also grabbing 7 rebounds.

Newman was born in Germany to an American father and German mother but raised in Jackson, Mississippi. He began playing organized basketball at the age of 9 and drew early comparisons to NBA superstar Kyrie Irving. After a strong high school career that culminated in him being named Mr Basketball in the state of Mississippi, Newman decided to play college ball at Mississippi State.

He had an up and down freshman season at MSU but really hit his stride this past year as he averaged 19 points per game while shooting nearly 40% from 3 point range. His play caught the attention of scouts from all over Europe and it wasn't long before he landed a contract offer from Ratiopharm Ulm.

Malik Newman is one of several young Americans who have decided to forego the traditional path of playing college ball in order to sign lucrative contracts with teams in Europe. This group includes Emmanuel Mudiay (Denver Nuggets), Terrance Ferguson (Oklahoma City Thunder) and Josh Jackson (Phoenix Suns). All three players were taken in the first round of this year's NBA draft.

Playing professionally in Europe is not for everyone and carries significant risk. The pay is generally not as good as what can be earned in America and there is little opportunity for advancement to higher levels or the NBA. However, for talented players like Malik Newman, it can be a dream come true. He now has an opportunity to showcase his skills against some of the best players in the world and hopefully lead Ratiopharm Ulm back to the Bundesliga playoffs.

"I am looking forward to proving my skills on the court and helping Ratiopharm Ulm make a run for the championship," Bilzerian said in a statement.

The 34-year-old has been known for his outrageous lifestyle and love of gambling. He made his fortune through various investments, but has also become known for his high-stakes poker games. In 2015, he won over $10 million from a single game.

Bilzerian's decision to play for Ratiopharm Ulm is already causing a stir in the basketball world. Some are saying that he is only joining the club to further promote himself, while others believe that he could help make the team a title contender.

Ratiopharm Ulm will open its season on September 29th against FC Bayern Munich.
