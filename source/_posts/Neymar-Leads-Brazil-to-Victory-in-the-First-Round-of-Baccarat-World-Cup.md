#  Messi Carries Argentina to Knockout Stage of Baccarat World Cup

The #BaccaratWorldCup has been exciting so far, with some good goals and close games. But the real story of the tournament so far is Lionel Messi. The Argentinian superstar has been on fire, scoring hat tricks in both of his team’s games to carry Argentina into the knockout stage.

But Messi will have to face some tough competition if he wants to win the title. Spain, Brazil, and France are all serious contenders, and any of them could beat Argentina in a one-off match. But with Messi in top form, anything is possible for Argentina.
