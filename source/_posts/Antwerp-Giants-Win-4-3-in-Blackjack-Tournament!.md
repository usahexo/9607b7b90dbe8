#  Antwerp Giants Win 4-3 in Blackjack Tournament!

The Antwerp Giants, who are the Belgian professional basketball club based in the city of Antwerp, won a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Brussels Lions in a blackjack tournament this past Saturday.

This was an especially sweet victory for the Giants, as they had lost to the Lions in their two previous meetings this season. In fact, the Giants were actually down 3-1 in the best-of-seven tournament before mounting a furious comeback to win the last three games and take home the championship!

“We really wanted to beat Brussels after they had beaten us twice earlier this season,” said Giants forward Youssoupha Fall after the game. “So we put all of our energy into winning this tournament. We played very well as a team and it feels great to have finally beaten them.”

Indeed, it was truly a team effort for the Giants, with every player chipping in at some point during the tournament. The biggest contributors for Antwerp were undoubtedly Fall (who averaged 20 points per game) and German point guard Maik Zirbes (17.5 points per game).

But it was not only their offense that led the Giants to victory; their defense was also impressive, particularly in Game 7 when they held Brussels to just 63 points. This allowed them to come back from their early three-game deficit and win the championship.

Now that they have won this blackjack tournament, the Antwerp Giants can add another trophy to their already impressive collection. They are currently one of Belgium’s most successful sports teams, having won numerous league championships and cup titles over the years.

In addition to the title and prize money, the Giants also walked away with some serious bragging rights. This marks their second major win in as many months, and they are quickly emerging as one of the top teams in blackjack.

#  Antwerp Giants Excel in Blackjack Tournament Play!

The Antwerp Giants are a Belgian professional basketball club that competes in the EuroCup. The team was established back in 1992, and has since enjoyed a great deal of success both domestically and internationally. This most recent victory is just one more feather in their cap!

The blackjack tournament at the Crown Casino was an eight-player event, with each player starting with a €10,000 stack. The final table featured some of the best blackjack players in the world, but it was the Giants who came out on top.

In the end, it was Jordy Donders who emerged victorious. He is a professional poker player from Belgium who has had plenty of experience playing blackjack tournaments. Heavily short-stacked going into the final table, Jordy managed to make a miraculous comeback and take down first place!
