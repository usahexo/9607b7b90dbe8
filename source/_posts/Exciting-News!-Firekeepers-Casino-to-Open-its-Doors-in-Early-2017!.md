#  Are You excited for Firekeepers Casino's Grand Opening?

Yes! The highly anticipated Firekeepers Casino is set to open this week and many people are excited about the possibilities it will bring. With its location near the I-94 and US-127 interchange, it is expected to draw people from all over Michigan and beyond.

The $164 million project is a joint venture between the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi and Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, who own and operate two other casinos in Michigan. The casino will feature more than 2,000 gaming machines, 60 table games, a high limit room, and several restaurants.

There has been some concern about how the casino will impact traffic in the area, but officials believe that it will actually help to reduce congestion by drawing people away from other casinos in Detroit and Windsor. In addition, the casino has agreed to pay nearly $2 million per year in lieu of taxes to local municipalities.

So far, it seems that the casino is off to a good start. More than 1,000 people have already registered for its player's club. And with promotions like "Double Your Fun," there's sure to be a lot of excitement in the air when it officially opens its doors on Thursday.
